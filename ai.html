        <h3>Project 1: AI Virtual Painter (OpenCV, Python)</h3>
        <p>
          Developed a gesture-based virtual painting application with real-time hand tracking. Users draw directly in the air, selecting from 7+ colors and an eraser tool via finger gestures.<br>
          Implemented multiple brush modes, canvas management, and creative filters. Key features:<br>

          Hand gesture recognition to switch between brushes, clear canvas, and save artwork without keyboard/mouse.<br>

          Drawing tools: normal brush, pixel brush, eraser, and customizable thickness.<br>

          UI integration with dynamic header bar for color selection and visual feedback.<br>

          Image processing & style transfer with OpenCV to apply cartoon and oil painting effects.<br>

          Automated saving system for storing completed drawings in PNG format.<br>
        </p>

        <h3>Project 2: Drawing Game (OpenCV, Python)</h3>
        <p>
          Built an interactive gesture-based drawing game using Python and OpenCV. Players receive randomized word prompts (e.g., “cat,” “robot,” “pizza”) and draw them in real time with hand tracking.<br>
          Implemented a 40-second timer, drawing via fingertip detection, and automatic saving of completed sketches. Key features:<br>

          Integrated hand tracking module for gesture detection and fingertip drawing input.<br>

          Designed a game loop with randomized prompts, countdown timer, and on-screen feedback.<br>

          Applied image processing techniques (masking, overlay blending, thresholding) to merge drawings with webcam feed.<br>

          Automated storage of player creations by saving canvas output as PNG images.<br>

        <h3>Project 3: Recommendation System (MovieLens, Python) </h3>
        <p>
          Built a movie recommendation engine using collaborative filtering and matrix factorization (SVD), achieving 20% lower RMSE than baseline popularity ranking on MovieLens dataset.<br>

          Implemented content-based filtering with TF-IDF on movie genres to personalize results.
