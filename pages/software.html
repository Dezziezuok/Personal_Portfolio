        <p>
          Developed a responsive web application with a conversational, chatbot-style interface to explain financial concepts such as budgeting, credit, saving, and investing in an approachable way.<br>

          Built interactive quizzes with real-time feedback and progress tracking to reinforce learning and measure user comprehension.<br>

          Integrated dynamic data visualizations to illustrate financial scenarios (e.g., savings growth, debt payoff timelines) and make abstract concepts tangible.<br>

          Applied component-based design in React with reusable UI elements and state management to ensure scalability and maintainability.<br>

          Designed with accessibility and mobile responsiveness in mind to reach a broader audience, especially young adults new to personal finance.<br>
