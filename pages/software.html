        <h3>Project 4: Password Security Strengthener (Java)</h3>
        <p>
          Built a Java console application that evaluates password strength on a 0–100 scale using regex-based rules 

          (length, case sensitivity, digits, and special characters), providing users with real-time feedback.<br> 

          If a password is deemed too weak, the program automatically generates a secure, randomized alternative 

          that meets strong security criteria.<br>
