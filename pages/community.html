          Currently <b>collaborating</b> with a <b>multidisciplinary</b> team to design and develop a wearable <b>fall detection device</b> for older adults. 

          The prototype will use an <b>Arduino</b> with built-in <b>motion sensors</b> to detect <b>sudden impacts</b> and <b>abnormal movement patterns</b>. 

          I’m working on <b>integrating</b> the <b>Arduino</b> with additional <b>hardware components</b> and contributing to the ongoing <b>embedded system design</b> and testing.<br><br>

         Laptops, one-on-one <b>guidance</b>, food, and drinks were <b>provided</b> to <b>support</b> everyone throughout the afternoon.
