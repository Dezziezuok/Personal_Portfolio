        <h3>[ In Progress ] Project 2: Desirae's Ransack Racetrack Typing Game (Unity, C#)</h3>
        <p>
          Developing an educational typing-based racing game in Unity with character selection, dynamic word spawning, and competitive gameplay. Implemented core systems in C#, including:<br>

          GameManager.cs – controls game flow, scoring, and timers.<br>

          Horse.cs / HorseSelectionManager.cs – allows players to select a racer and manages character movement tied to typing accuracy.<br>

          NPCOpponent.cs – creates AI-controlled NPC racers to compete against players.<br>

          Word.cs / WordInput.cs / WordDisplay.cs – handles random word generation, user input detection, and real-time visual feedback.<br>

          PlayerStats.cs – tracks player performance, accuracy, and progress across races.<br>
